# An Enhanced Wildfire Spread Prediction Using Multimodal Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning Models
#### The original Next Day Wildfire Spread dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fantineh/next-day-wildfire-spread 
#### The enhanced dataset we used in this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rufaiyusufzakari/enhanced-and-modified-next-day-wildfire-spread 
Based on the dataset of Huot et al.; [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/simulation_research/next_day_wildfire_spread).


### üìÅ Files and Directories Overview

- **`datasets.py`**: Custom PyTorch `Dataset` classes tailored for loading and handling wildfire data.

- **`pickle_wildfire_datasets.py`**: Processes the original dataset by extracting random 32√ó32 crops, converting them to NumPy arrays, and saving them as pickle files.

- **`pickle_full_wildfire_datasets.py`**: Converts full 64√ó64 wildfire data into NumPy arrays and pickles them.
